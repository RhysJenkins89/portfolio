# Portfolio

I'm currently redesigning and rebuilding my portfolio site.

## Doing

-   Add route error handling

## To do

-   Commit test
-   Build a backend service in Node to handle the form
-   Update the light/dark theme colours
-   Remove the maps Node modules
-   Add the scss to the webpack build
-   Add a What I'm working on section
-   Add a form, which when submitted sends the user's data to a database
-   Build a backend with email/text submission functionality
-   Build/find a system for the correct font-size values across devices
-   Change the browser tab icon colour depending on the browser theme
-   Accessibility throughout the site
-   Add a recaptcha to the form

## General notes

### How to run the site

To build the TypeScript, run `npm run dev`. This command will run Webpack, which will build the TyepScript and watch for updates.

To build the CSS, run `npm run sass`. This command will build the SCSS and watch for updates.

### Notes on the code

The `text` class allows any text to which it is applied to transition from light to dark with the theme.
