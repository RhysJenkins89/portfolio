# Portfolio

I'm currently redesigning and rebuilding my portfolio site. Commit test.

## Doing

-   Build the landing intro section

## To do

-   Create a logo for the browser tab
-   Add the scss to the webpack build
-   Add a What I'm working on section
-   Build/find a system for the correct font-size values across devices
-   Change the browser tab icon colour depending on the browser theme
-   Accessibility throughout the site
-   Cursor spotlight effect

## General notes

### How to run the site

To build the TypeScript, run `npm run dev`. This command will run Webpack, which will build the TyepScript and watch for updates.

To build the CSS, run `npm run sass`. This command will build the SCSS and watch for updates.

### Notes on the code

The `text` class allows any text to which it is applied to transition from light to dark with the theme.
