# Portfolio

I'm currently redesigning and rebuilding my portfolio site. Come back soon!

## To do

* Add a light mode/dark mode toggle
* Determine the user's light/dark mode preference
* Add colour themes
* Add a form, which when submitted sends the user's data to a database
* Build a backend with email/text submission functionality
* Build/find a system for the correct font-size values across devices
