# Portfolio

I'm currently redesigning and rebuilding my portfolio site.

## Doing

-   Revert to two themes only because what even is life

## To do

-   Build project cards, loop over data
-   Write new/better copy
-   Add a projects/what I'm doing section
-   Add a form, which when submitted sends the user's data to a database
-   Build a backend with email/text submission functionality
-   Build/find a system for the correct font-size values across devices
-   Change the browser tab icon colour depending on the browser theme
