# Portfolio

I'm currently redesigning and rebuilding my portfolio site.

## Doing

-   Add the scss to the webpack build

## To do

-   Build project cards, loop over data
-   Write new/better copy
-   Add a projects/what I'm doing section
-   Add a form, which when submitted sends the user's data to a database
-   Build a backend with email/text submission functionality
-   Build/find a system for the correct font-size values across devices
-   Change the browser tab icon colour depending on the browser theme

## General notes

The `text` class allows any text that it's applied to to transition from light to dark with the theme.
