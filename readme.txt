Readme: Portfolio project

I've put the todo section here at the top of the file in order to make it easy to see at a glance what I'm going to be working on. In this readme, I also discuss the tools I used to build this site and the design of the site, in addition to general thoughts on the project.

// Currently I'm working on: 
* Rewriting the BEM notation throughout the site

// Todo:
* Reorganise the sass files so the buttons are in one folder, the text is in one folder, etc
* Completely refactor the nav section
* Continue to rewrite the BEM notation
* Load dark mode based on user's system preference
* Research a better fix for the hamburger colour functionality

// Tools
* HTML
* Sass
* JavaScript
    * jQuery
    * waypoints.js

The tools I used to build this site are fairly self-explanatory. For my purposes, HTML, Sass, and JavaScript cover everything that I need for simple static site. I don't need to link to a database, so I don't need to use any backend technologies.  

I aim to keep my HTML and Sass simple and readable. At the moment, I'm rewriting the BEM notation throughout the site. When I began building the site in late 2020, I didn't fully understand BEM notation. However, now that I have researched the topic in more detail, I better understand how to write simple, clear classes that any developer could pick and use relatively quickly.
